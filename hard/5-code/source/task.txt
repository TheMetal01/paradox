Task:
    • Analyze the recursive function decrypt(input).
    • The conversion follows this pattern: 1 → a, 2 → b, 3 → c, ..., 26 → z
    • Determine the hidden word then convert every single charcter into digit using given pattern
    • Ex:word apple input[]=”1,16,16,12,5”;
    • Then put that digit into input[]=”..,..,”
    • Then call decrypt(input).
    • Get the  appropriate flag
    • Submit the flag in the format: CTF{word} 


Hint:
    • The function processes the number digit by digit and converts it into letters.
    • The conversion follows this pattern: 1 → a, 2 → b, 3 → c, ..., 26 → z
    • The output is a 6-letter word related to cybersecurity.
    • The word describes a person skilled in computer security.
    • Often associated with CTFs, ethical hacking, and penetration testing.
